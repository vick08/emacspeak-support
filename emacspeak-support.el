;;; Commentary:
;; This module provides a unified interface for enabling and disabling
;; Emacspeak support extensions for modern Emacs packages. Each extension
;; can be toggled on or off independently.
;;
;; Usage:
;;   M-x emacspeak-support-enable-corfu
;;   M-x emacspeak-support-enable-which-key
;;   M-x emacspeak-support-enable-markdown
;;   M-x emacspeak-support-enable-voiceover
;;   M-x emacspeak-support-toggle-<extension>
;;   M-x emacspeak-support-enable-all
;;   M-x emacspeak-support-disable-all
;;   M-x emacspeak-support-status
