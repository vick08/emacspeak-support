;;; Commentary:
;; Corfu is a modern in-buffer completion UI that uses Emacs's native
;; completion engine. This module speech-enables Corfu's UI to provide
;; auditory feedback for completion candidates.

;;; Code:

;;   Required modules:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl-lib))
(require 'emacspeak-preamble)
(require 'corfu nil 'noerror)

;;;  Silence byte-compiler about special variables:

(defvar corfu--candidates)
(defvar corfu--index)
(defvar corfu--metadata)
(defvar completion-in-region-mode)

;;;  Forward declarations:

(declare-function corfu--update "corfu" (&optional interruptible))

;;;  Map faces to voices:

(voice-setup-add-map
 '((corfu-default voice-smoothen)
   (corfu-current voice-bolden)
   (corfu-bar voice-monotone)
   (corfu-border voice-smoothen)
   (corfu-annotations voice-annotate)
   (corfu-deprecated voice-monotone-extra)))

;;;  Bookkeeping variables for UI state:

(defvar-local emacspeak-corfu--prev-candidate nil
  "Previously spoken candidate.")

(defvar-local emacspeak-corfu--prev-index nil
  "Index of previously spoken candidate.")
